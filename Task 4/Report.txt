CYBER SECURITY INTERNSHIP â€“ TASK 4-3  
Title: Basic Firewall Configuration using UFW on Linux (Kali)

Objective:
To configure and test basic firewall rules using UFW on Linux for allowing and denying network traffic based on port numbers.

OS Used:
Kali Linux (Debian-based)

Steps Performed:

1. Enabled UFW:
   sudo ufw enable

2. Verified Firewall Status:
   sudo ufw status verbose
   Output:
   - Status: active
   - Default: deny (incoming), allow (outgoing)

3. Allowed SSH port (22):
   sudo ufw allow 22

4. Denied Telnet port (23):
   sudo ufw deny 23

5. Tested Port 23 using Telnet:
   telnet localhost 23
   Output: Connection refused (expected, because port 23 is blocked)

6. Removed test rule to restore state:
   sudo ufw delete deny 23

Screenshot:
See 'Screenshot of UFW(1).png' in the repository.

Key Concepts Practiced:
- Firewall traffic control (Inbound rule blocking)
- UFW command usage
- Port-based rule testing (Telnet for port 23)
- Secure access rule (allowing SSH)

Notes:
- Telnet is blocked for security reasons (unencrypted).
- UFW is a user-friendly interface for managing iptables.
